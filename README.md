# OM-Data library

**OM-Data** is a currently developing library of elementary functions, mostly aimed at data processing and analysis in **OpenMusic**. The library includes functions for data metrics, classification, sorting, and handling, as well as some functions for midicent manipulation.
These include `K-means`, `DTW`, `NNS`, `List-moments`, `Euclidean-distance`, `Chroma-count`, `IC-vector`, `List-Zscore`, `List-wrap`, `List-fold`, among others.

A list of example patches are included, demonstrating possible musical applications of some these functions.

Since **OM-Data** is still in its early stages, only beta releases will be made at the moment.

For info on how to install external libraries in **OM** visit: https://support.ircam.fr/docs/om-libraries/main/co/OM-Libraries.html 

Once the library is installed and loaded into the **OM** workspace, the example patches will be available in `/Help/Import Tutorial Patches/Libraries/OM-Data`
