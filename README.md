# OM-Data library

**OM-Data** is a currently developing library of elementary functions, mostly aimed at data processing and analysis in **OpenMusic**. The library includes functions for data metrics, classification, sorting, and processing, as well as some functions for midicent manipulation.

A list of example patches are included, demonstrating possible musical applications of some these functions.

Since **OM-Data** is still in its early stages, only beta releases will be made at the moment.
