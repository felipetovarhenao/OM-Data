# OM-FTH library

This is an on-going **OpenMusic** library with additional list processing tools â€” the idea is to provide tools for basic list transformation, analysis, and classification, such as list quantization, Euclidean distance, or NNS.

No official releases will be made as of yet, but anyone is free to try it in the meantime.
